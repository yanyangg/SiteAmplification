# SiteAmplification
This work is to calculate site amplification given a 1D model. 
Vertically incident body wave site amplification is computed using propagation matrix method (Aki & Richards, 2002).
Horizontally propagating surface wave site amplification is including body and surface waves (Bowden & Tsai, 2017).
The surface wave integrals are calcualated using the MATLAB package forked from [Yiran Ma ](https://github.com/yiran06/mat_disperse)
